# Color Picker

Color Picker is a Python-based application that allows the user to upload an image and identify the closest color name (and its corresponding hex code) by clicking on different points within the image.

## Architecture

This application is built using the [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) framework, and utilizes a SQLite database for storing and retrieving color data.
